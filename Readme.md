<h2>About Me</h2>

- 🎓 I recently graduated from the Northcoders Bootcamp, where I gained a solid foundation in Full-Stack web development.
- 👨‍💻 I love to code and explore new technologies, and I'm currently working on improving my skills in TypeScript.
- 🍕 Fun fact: I'm a skilled cook and love to make homemade pizzas from scratch. From mixing the dough to selecting the toppings, there's nothing quite like the satisfaction of a piping hot pizza straight from the oven!

<h2>About</h2>

I'm a graduate Full-Stack developer living in Manchester 🐝 🇬🇧. When I'm not coding, you can find me listening to tech podcasts, reading books, or hitting the pavement for a jog in nature.
